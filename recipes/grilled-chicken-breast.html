    <p>The best grilled chicken breasts you'll ever make begin with a basic marinade and end with the best technique for perfect cooking, complete with beautifully-executed grill marks.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>The perfect marinade consists of five elements,
                <br>according recipe developer and senior producer Nicole McLaughlin:
                <br>something salty, something sweet, an acid, a fat, and aromatics.
                <br>Here’s what you’ll need for this perfect chicken marinade:
            </p>
            <h4>Marinade:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Our perfect marinade starts with olive oil, which is essential for locking in moisture. </li>
                <li><strong>Dijon:</strong> Dijon mustard adds complex, sharp, pleasantly tangy flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Honey:</strong> Honey lends subtle sweetness.</li>
                <li><strong>Soy sauce:</strong> Soy sauce adds umami-rich saltiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Lemon juice:</strong> Lemon juice brightens things up a bit.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Of course, fresh garlic is necessary for the most flavorful marinade.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground spices:</strong>Onion powder and ground ginger take the flavor up a notch.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How to cook chicken breast on the grill</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Trim the chicken and pound to an even thickness.</li>
                <li>Make the marinade, then marinate the chicken at least four hours or up to overnight.</li>
                <li>Grill the chicken.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>How long to grill chicken breast</h4>
            <p>You’ll know the chicken is perfectly cooked when it releases easily
                <br>and has dark brown grill marks. This should take about 3 minutes per side,
                <br>but we can’t underestimate the importance of a meat thermometer.
                <br>Inserted into the thickest part of the breast, the thermometer should read at least 165 degrees F.
